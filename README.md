# 🚀SPA-application realization with React/Redux/Typescript + Webpack and Material UI for Pryaniky.com🍪

To run application plaese use GitHub Pages
or
clone repository: 
```
https://github.com/lostvermeer/Table-Pro.git
```
and run in terminal
```
npm install
npm run start
```

I have changed values of build script:
```
"build": "webpack --mode=development" 
```
and build:dev script
```
"build:dev": "webpack --mode=production --node-env=production" 
```
so that gh-pages could run repo properly

### Further work

- Set the proper typing 
- Refactor Login page
- Optimze webpack 
- Error handling in FormModal
